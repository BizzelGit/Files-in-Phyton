Let’s read a JSON file! Start by importing the json module.
Open up the file message.json, saving the file object to the variable message_json.

Open the file in read-mode, without passing any additional arguments to open().
Pass the JSON file object as an argument to json.load() and save the resulting Python dictionary as message.
Print out message['text'].

__________________________________________

import json

with open('message.json') as message_json:
 message = json.load(message_json)
print(message['text'])

In your workspace, we’ve put a dictionary called data_payload. We want to save this to a file called data.json.

Let’s start by importing the json library.
Open a new file object in the variable data_json. The filename should be 'data.json' and the file should be opened in write-mode.
Call json.dump() with data_payload and data_json to convert our data to JSON and then save it to the file data.json.

__________________________________________

data_payload = [
  {'interesting message': 'What is JSON? A web application\'s little pile of secrets.',
   'follow up': 'But enough talk!'}
]

import json

with open('data.json','w') as data_json:
  json.dump(data_payload, data_json)
