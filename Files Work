Using a with statement, create a file object pointing to the file how_many_lines.txt. Store that file object in the variable lines_doc.
Iterate through each of the lines in lines_doc.readlines() using a for loop.
Inside the for loop print out each line of how_many_lines.txt.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
with open('how_many_lines.txt') as lines_doc:
  for line in lines_doc.readlines():
    print(line)

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Using a with statement, create a file object pointing to the file just_the_first.txt. Store that file object in the variable first_line_doc.
Save the first line of just_the_first.txt into the variable first_line.
Print out the variable first_line.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
with open('just_the_first.txt') as first_line_doc:
  first_line = first_line_doc.readline()

print(first_line)

Create a file object for the file bad_bands.txt using the open() function with the w argument. Assign this object to the temporary variable bad_bands_doc.
Use the bad_bands_doc.write() method to add the name of a musical group you dislike to the document bad_bands.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
with open('bad_bands.txt', 'w') as bad_bands_doc:
  bad_bands_doc.write("Linkin Park")

We’ve got a file, cool_dogs.txt, filled with all the cool dogs we know. Somehow while compiling this list we forgot about one very cool dog. Let’s fix that problem by adding him to our cool_dogs.txt.
Open up our file cool_dogs.txt in append-mode and assign it to the file object cool_dogs_file.
Inside your with block, add “Air Buddy\n” to cool_dogs.txt. Air Buddy is a Golden Retriever that plays basketball, which more than qualifies him for this list. The \n character moves to the next line after appending the string.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
with open('cool_dogs.txt', 'a') as cool_dogs_file:
  cool_dogs_file.write("Air Buddy\n")

In script.py there’s a file object that doesn’t get closed correctly. Let’s fix it by changing the syntax!
Remove this line:
close_this_file = open('fun_file.txt')
And change it to use the with syntax from our previous exercises.
Remember to indent the rest of the body so that we don’t get an IndentError.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

with open('fun_file.txt') as close_this_file:
  setup = close_this_file.readline()
  punchline = close_this_file.readline()

print(setup)

 CSV files are just plain text files!
Open logger.csv using our standard with syntax, saving the file object in the temporary variable log_csv_file.
Print out the contents of logger.csv by calling .read() on the file. Notice that it is parsed as a string.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
with open('logger.csv') as log_csv_file:
  test = log_csv_file.read()
  print(test)

Import the csv module.
Open up the file cool_csv.csv in the temporary variable cool_csv_file.
Using csv.DictReader read the contents of cool_csv_file into a new variable called cool_csv_dict.
cool_csv.csv includes a cool fact about every person in the CSV.
For each row in cool_csv_dict print out that row’s "Cool Fact".

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
import csv

with open('cool_csv.csv') as cool_csv_file:
  cool_csv_dict = csv.DictReader(cool_csv_file)
  for row in cool_csv_dict:
    print(row)
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Import the csv module.
Open up the file books.csv in the variable books_csv.
Create a DictReader instance that uses the @ symbol as a delimiter to read books_csv. Save the result in a variable called books_reader.
Create a list called isbn_list, iterate through books_reader to get the ISBN number of every book in the CSV file. Use the ['ISBN'] key for the dictionary objects passed to it.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


import csv

with open('books.csv') as books_csv:
  books_reader = csv.DictReader(books_csv,delimiter = "@")
  isbn_list = []
  for row in books_reader:
    isbn_list.append(row['ISBN'])
